# Implementation Overview

This implementation guide is for front-end developers or technical marketers who want to learn how to implement the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] solutions in their website.

A detailed guide to set up [!DNL Launch] for use inside a mobile app with the [!DNL Adobe Experience Platform] SDK v5 is available [here](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/).

Each lesson contains how-to exercises and foundational information to help you implement the [!DNL Experience Cloud] and understand its value. Callouts are provided to highlight information which might be useful to customers migrating from the older tag manager, [!DNL Dynamic Tag Management (DTM)]. Demo sites are provided for you to complete the tutorial, so you can learn the underlying techniques in a safe environment. After completing this tutorial, you should be comfortable implementing these solutions as well as non-[!DNL Adobe] marketing tags on your own website.

This guide shows you how to:

* Create a [!DNL Launch] property
* Install a [!DNL Launch] property on a website
* Add the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] solution extensions, including:

  * [!DNL Experience Cloud ID Service]
  * [!DNL Adobe Target]
  * [!DNL Adobe Analytics]
  * [!DNL Adobe Audience Manager]
* Create rules and data elements to send data to the [!DNL Adobe] solutions
* Validate the implementation using the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud Debugger]
* Publish changes in [!DNL Launch] through development, staging, and production environments  

## Prerequisites

These lessons assume that you have an [!DNL Adobe ID] and the required [!DNL Launch] permissions (Develop, Approve, Publish, Manage Extensions, and Manage Environments) needed to complete the exercises. If you do not have these, contact your [!DNL Experience Cloud] Administrator to request access.

* For [!DNL Launch], you must have permission to Develop, Approve, Publish, Manage Extensions, and Manage Environments. For more information on Launch permissions, see the [documentation](../launch-reference/administration/user-permissions.md).
* For [!DNL Adobe Analytics], you must know your tracking server and which report suites you will use to complete this tutorial.
* For [!DNL Audience Manager], you must know your [!DNL Audience Manager] Subdomain (also known as the Partner Name, Partner ID, or Partner Subdomain).

Also, it is assumed that you are familiar with front-end development languages like HTML and JavaScript. You do not need to be a master of these languages to complete the lessons, but you will get more out of them if you can comfortably read and understand code.

## About the Lessons

In these lessons, you’ll be implementing the [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud] into a fake retail website called We.Retail. The We.Retail site has rich functionality that will allow you to build a realistic implementation that resembles a real implementation.  You will build your own Launch property, in your own [!DNL Experience Cloud] organization, and map it to the [!DNL Adobe]-hosted We.Retail site using the [!DNL Experience Cloud Debugger].
