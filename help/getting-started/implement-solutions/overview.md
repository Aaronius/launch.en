# Implement Solutions

These implementation tutorials guide you through the steps required to implement the [Experience Cloud ID Service](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/). The [!DNL ID Service] sets a common visitor ID across all Adobe solutions in order to power [!DNL Experience Cloud] capabilities such as audience-sharing between solutions. You can also send your own customer IDs to the [!DNL ID Service] to enable additional integrations with your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems.

Solutions are implemented using [!DNL Launch] extensions. Extensions are one of the core features of [!DNL Launch]. An extension is an integration built by [!DNL Adobe], an [!DNL Adobe] partner, or any [!DNL Adobe] customer that adds new and endless options for the tags that you can deploy to your website. If you think of [!DNL Launch] as an operating system, extensions are the apps that you install so [!DNL Launch] can do the things you need it to do.
